Unveiling Hidden Connections in Stock Markets:Econometrics Coursework Deep Dive
====

In this group coursework for MSc, we'll embark on a journey to uncover intricate relationships within financial markets. Using OxMetrics9, we'll analyze a rich dataset of four daily stock price indices spanning two decades. Get ready to flex your econometrics muscles as we tackle these exciting challenges:

* Data Transformation and Stationarity: We'll carefully prepare the data, transforming it into quarterly averages and logarithmic form, before assessing its stationarity using unit root tests.
* Model Specification and Selection: We'll explore a range of autoregressive distributed lags (ADL) models to capture the relationship between EURO STOXX 50 and NIKKEI 225, meticulously selecting the best fit based on misspecification tests.
* Cointegration vs Spurious Regression: We'll dive into the delicate dance between cointegration and spurious correlation, investigating whether CAC40 and NIKKEI 225 truly cointegrate or merely exhibit superficial connections.
* Granger Causality: We'll unravel the potential causal influence of NIKKEI 225 on other stock prices, shedding light on predictive dynamics within the markets.
* ARCH and GARCH Modeling: We'll delve into volatility modeling using ARCH and GARCH techniques, accounting for time-varying conditional variances and enhancing risk management strategies
