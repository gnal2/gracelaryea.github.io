In my Time Series Modeling and Simulation course (MAST6390), I tackled an assessment that delved deep into the fascinating world of ARMA models. Using R, I embarked on a journey of data exploration and analysis, starting with the simulation of a time series using an ARMA(2,1) model. Then, I donned my detective hat and unraveled the patterns hidden within the data through time series plots, ACF, and PACF analyses. My mission next was to capture the essence of the data by fitting two models: ARMA(2,2) and ARMA(2,1). But alas, only one could be crowned the champion. Guided by statistical clues and model interpretability, I meticulously selected the most fitting candidate. To ensure its true reign, I subjected it to rigorous diagnostic tests, using the tsdiag command and Ljung-Box test to scrutinize its every residual. Through this assessment, I honed my skills in simulating, analyzing, and evaluating time series models, proving myself a worthy champion of the time series domain.
